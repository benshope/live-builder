## App Engine CMS

I love Wordpress, but it has limitations.

Google App Engine CMS is a re-thinking of the simple CMS - built fast, flexible, and scalable.

For some developers, this CMS will just save them time they would spend construcing things like pages, posts, users, comments, and a contact form for a simple website.

For other developers, the main benefit of this CMS will be as a best-practices boilerplate - a starting-point to create amazing web experiences with AngularJS and Google App Engine.
