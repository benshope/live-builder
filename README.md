## Live Site Builder

This is a project that allows fairly non-techical people to edit CSS/HTML/contenteditable-text in their browser and watch the results of their changes appear immediately.  And by immediately, I mean instantly, not after-a-save like Wordpress or after-a-second like SquareSpace.

This idea has potential because build/deploy processes put some amount of time between when a user creates something and when they see the results their work.  I think people underestimate how much that (even very small) amount of time saps the creative energy that a human being feels while they are putting together a project.
